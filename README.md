# DSUP-acidic-config
Code and data use in research into DSUP changing structure

Methodology:
- [Calculate pI for DSUP](Calculate-isoelectric-point/)
- [Generating a plot for DSUP Net Charge vs. pH](https://github.com/Katherine-Brown-8000/DSUP-acidic-config/tree/main/Net-charge-plot)
- [DSUP electrostatic potential diagram](https://github.com/Katherine-Brown-8000/DSUP-acidic-config/tree/main/DSUP%20electrostatic%20potential%20diagram)

- Net charge vs pH
- MD simulations
- Disorder prediction
- Electrostatics
- Aggregation
- Structural comparison

This figure was generated using ChimeraX from the DSUP files for pH 5.5, 7.4 and 11.5
- A) is DSUP at pH 5.5
- B) is DSUP at pH 7.4
- C) is DSUP at pH 11.5
- D) is DSUP at all three difference pHs overlapped

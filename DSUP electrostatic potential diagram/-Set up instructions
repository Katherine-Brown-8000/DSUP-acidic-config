Instructions for how the models were generated for DSUP.

1) Go to Alphafold 3 with the protein sequence for DSUP, this will give you a fold analysis folder for DSUP
2) From the fold analysis folder, the fold_analysis_dsup_model_1.ciff was run in ChimeraX to generate dsup_model_0.pdb
3) On the poissonboltzmann.org dsup_model_0.pdb was used to generate various structures using PDB2PQR for DSUP at different of 5.5, 7.4 and 11.5 in the for of .pqr and .in files
4) the pqr. and .in file where then run in APBS to generate the elctrostatic potential map in dx. format
